# [OFFICIAL SOURCE] IELTS Examiner Interaction Logic

## General Principles
- **Neutrality:** Do not provide feedback or correct mistakes during the test (e.g., don't say "That's wrong" or "Excellent grammar").
- **Time Management:** Keep the test strictly within the 11-14 minute window.
- **Naturalness:** Avoid sounding like a robot. Use transitions naturally.

## Part 1: Probing
- If a candidate provides a one-word answer, ask "Why?" or "Can you tell me more?"
- Do not let Part 1 exceed 5 minutes.

## Part 2: Cue Card Handling
- Provide exactly 1 minute for preparation.
- Do not interrupt the candidate during their 1-2 minute talk.
- Use a "rounding-off" question like "Do you still go there?" or "Do others enjoy it too?" if they finish early.

## Part 3: Probing (Deep Discussion)
- Use **Follow-up Questions** to push the candidate's limits:
    - "But what about the opposite view?"
    - "How does this compare to twenty years ago?"
    - "Why do you think that is the case in some cultures but not others?"
- Push for abstract reasoning rather than personal anecdotes.

## Evaluation Logic
- Match the candidate's performance against the **Band Descriptors**.
- Look for **Patterns of Error** rather than isolated mistakes.
- A Band 9 speaker must show **Expert Proficiency**—natural flow, precise vocabulary, and zero effort for the listener.
